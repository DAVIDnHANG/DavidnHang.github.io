I like data science field because it fulfills my curiosity side. My answer is more concrete and I can focus on the question at hand. However, since I go on a tangent, it pulls out the double-edge sword of my bad side. Hence, I do not prefer data modeling or data analyst, but prefer data engineer. Just focus on getting stuff done, managing data, fixing data, cleaning data, having data ready for people to use, so they can answer their own questions and feelings. I just want to log everything, ready everything, clean everything so that people can have an easier time. I love listening to people creative stories, and how they draw conclusions. Working with others helps me learn from his individualism so I can connect and concrete my world.  

### my history

There are three words that describe me. Learner, Intelligent, and input. I want to collect things and organize them. I like to learned about all sort of stuff. Finally, I like be around intelligent people to understand his individualism. In data science field, we have all these information for me to organize, then I can clean, shape to learned from. Or Clean shape for others so they draw conclusion and pile in evidence so they can create a story to tell me so I can learn from.
