CNN to classify images from the game in order to build an internal representation
of the worlds.  Alogrithm works as follows:
1. Grab still images from game and passes it to CNN
2.CNN predicts what is occurring in still image
3. These prediction pass to an internal map of the worlds. 
4. internal map of the world is then updated based on the latest predictions
5. given the present state of the internal map of the world
6. number of actions are generated
7. these actions are then translated into mouse and keyboard input and sent to the mouse and keyboards.
8. loop is repeated indinitely.

Visual Input
 1) Use projection matrix for the game is approximated.
   a)determine the 3d coordinates that coorespond to 2d coordinates on the screen and visa-versa
   b)   Aw=p such that A is the projection Matrix, w is the matrix of world and p is matrix of projected points
   c) to find the matrix of A, use several object of fixed size in the game. Then
 2)Manually, on a 800x600 resolution, approximate corner of the screen with a point and labeled with the corresponding world point
