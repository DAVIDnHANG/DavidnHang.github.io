Why did Tax Revenue stop rising? From a historic sense, World War I happened in 1917-1919. 
Then the great depression happened in 1928-1940. 
However, tax revenue hardly rose above 1940 level again. Despite being in World War II, vietnam war, korean war, gulf war, and cold war. Additionally, observe how this graph starts at 1913. It start at 1913 because U.S constitution Amendment 16 passed allowing congress to imposing income taxes.
